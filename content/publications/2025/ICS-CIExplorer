Extending existing architectures with customized instruction extensions is emerging to achieve high performance and energy efficiency for specific applications. Automated discovery of custom instructions (CIs) is well-studied nowadays, which requires exploring combinations of different types and quantities of operations, resulting in a vast search space.
However, previous works typically use microarchitecture-agnostic cost models, leading to suboptimal CIs that may degrade performance. They leverage graph isomorphism to reduce area overhead, but few of them consider its potential to benefit performance-oriented exploration.
To this end, we present CIExplorer, a framework for CI exploration. We propose a Seed Growth Method based on a genetic algorithm to discover CIs with the consideration of graph similarity. We also propose a compiler-assisted modeling strategy that applies a microarchitecture-aware cost model to estimate the potential benefits of CIs for different microarchitectures.
 We evaluate our framework using various benchmarks in SPEC2006 and Mediabench on in-order, 2-wide OOO, and 4-wide OOO processors. 
Experimental results demonstrate that CIExplorer achieves average performance improvements of 1.09$\times$ and 1.13$\times$ and energy improvements of 1.07$\times$ and 1.10$\times$ compared with Novia and MaxClique.
